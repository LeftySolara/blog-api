# Personal Blog API

This is a small, simple API for managing posts in a personal blog.

This is a toy project I'm working on in my spare time to learn some specific
tools and technologies. I am not planning to make it fully-featured, so things
such as authentication, authorization, or a GUI to interact with it will not be
made available.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language

- TypeScript 5.6.2

### Backend Framework

- Hono 4.6.13
- Hono Node Server 1.13.7

### Database

- PostgreSQL 8.13.1
- Drizzle ORM 0.38.2

### Miscellaneous

- Zod 3.24.1 (for request validation)
- Pino 9.5.0 (for logging)
- ESLint 9.17.0 (linter)
- Prettier 3.4.2 (formatter)
